# Image_enhancement_model_UNET
Image enhancement with Image Super-Resolution using U-Net. This project trains a U-Net model to upscale low-resolution images (64×64) into high-resolution outputs (256×256). The encoder-decoder with skip connections captures both local and global features, enhancing detail and clarity.
